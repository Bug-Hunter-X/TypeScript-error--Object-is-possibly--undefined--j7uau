This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error related to type guards and the `undefined` type.  The `printName` function is designed to handle both string and null values. However, when passing `undefined`, TypeScript correctly flags a potential error because the type guard `if (name)` doesn't explicitly handle the `undefined` case.  The solution showcases how to handle `undefined` explicitly to resolve the error.
